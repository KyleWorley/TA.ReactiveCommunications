## Reactive-style transactional device communications for [ASCOM][ascom] drivers with guaranteed sequencing and thread-safety ##

[Reactive ASCOM][wiki] (namespace TA.Ascom.ReactiveCommunications) is a library based on the [Reactive Extensions for .NET][rx] for simplifying device communications over serial, Ethernet and other types of communications channel to embedded device controllers.

Originally designed as an aid for developers of [ASCOM][ascom] device drivers,
the library may be of use in any situation where a client application
needs to communicate with some connected device.

Rx comms leverages Rx.net to guarantee correct sequencing and thread-safety of transactions. It is also useful for reacting to
the device's received data stream and updating UI controls with
fresh data, without running into cross-thread control update issues.

For usage instructions and background information, [please refer to the wiki pages][wiki], which also serves as the project home page.

Available as a [NuGet][4] package - simply `Install-Package TA.Ascom.ReactiveCommunications`
