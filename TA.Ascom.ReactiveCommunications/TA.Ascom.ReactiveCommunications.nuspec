        <description>
          A library based on the Reactive Extensions for .NET for simplifying device communications over serial, Ethernet and other types
          of communications channel to embedded controllers, while guaranteeing correct sequencing and thread-safety of transactions.
          Originally developed for use with ASCOM drivers, but may be useful for any software that needs to communicate with an embedded
          controller using a command/response protocol.
